Given the following array of arrays of numbers representing a list of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

 [[6,12],[16,24],[16,19],[24,28],[16,19],[20,23],[18,24],[11,20],[1,5]]

 Example:

 [[1, 3], [8, 10], [2, 6], [10, 16]]

 would merge into [[1, 6], [8, 16]].

 The intervals must be returned in ASCENDING order. You can assume that in an interval, the first number will always be smaller than the second.
