Given the following integer array, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the 
largest sum and return that sum. 'Sum' refers to the sum of all the numbers in the subarray.

 7,-8,-10,-5,-9,6,4,-2,-9,-6,-1,9,-9,-6,7,10,-9,-8,-9,-5,10,-3,-1,-4,3,7,10,-3,5,2,7,9,-2,6,-9,2

 If your solution is an empty string, you must leave the text box empty. Do not use "", '', or ``.
