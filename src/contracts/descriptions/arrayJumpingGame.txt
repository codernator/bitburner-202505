You are given the following array of integers:

 10,10,4

 Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n. 

Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine whether you are able to reach the last index.

 Your answer should be submitted as 1 or 0, representing true and false respectively.
