You are given the following encoded binary string: 
 '0110000000000000100000000100110001000101000000101111111101111101' 

 Decode it as an 'extended Hamming code' and convert it to a decimal value.
 The binary string may include leading zeroes.
 A parity bit is inserted at position 0 and at every position N where N is a power of 2.
 Parity bits are used to make the total number of '1' bits in a given set of data even.
 The parity bit at position 0 considers all bits including parity bits.
 Each parity bit at position 2^N alternately considers 2^N bits then ignores 2^N bits, starting at position 2^N.
 The endianness of the parity bits is reversed compared to the endianness of the data bits:
 Data bits are encoded most significant bit first and the parity bits encoded least significant bit first.
 The parity bit at position 0 is set last.
 There is a ~55% chance for an altered bit at a random index.
 Find the possible altered bit, fix it and extract the decimal value.

 Examples:

 '11110000' passes the parity checks and has data bits of 1000, which is 8 in binary.
 '1001101010' fails the parity checks and needs the last bit to be corrected to get '1001101011', after which the data bits are found to be 10101, which is 21 in binary.
